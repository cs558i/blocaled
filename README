OpenRC-settingsd provides an implementation of the the localed
D-Bus service for OpenRC-based systems - in particular, for
typical installations of Gentoo Linux.

It is maintained by Gentoo's GNOME desktop team, which can be contacted
via gnome@gentoo.org, or in #gentoo-desktop on Freenode IRC.

Homepage: http://gnome.gentoo.org/openrc-settingsd.xml

Bugs should be reported to Gentoo Bugzilla (https://bugs.gentoo.org/)
using "GNOME" as the component.

Localed:

 See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/localed for the D-Bus
 protocol description.

 The system locale variables are set in /etc/env.d/02locale.

 Virtual console keymap is set in /etc/conf.d/keymaps as
 keymap="foo"
 The virtual console keymap toggle is not supported.

 X11 keyboard options are set in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-keyboard.conf
 (falling back to 00-keyboard.conf if it exists and 30-keyboard.conf does
 not). See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xorg-config.xml for configuration
 information.

Note that OpenRC-settingsd expects any shell-syntax settings files that it
modifies to be in UTF-8 encoding, and to consist only of comments and simple
scalar assignments, i.e. something like

# a comment
foo="bar"
baz='Let'\''s go!'

If OpenRC-settingsd fails to parse a settings file, it will refuse to modify
it.
