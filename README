Blocaled provides a stand-alone implementation of the localed D-Bus service.

It is maintained by BLFS editor Pierre Labastie, for the specific needs of
the BLFS project, but may be used on any system implementing the libgio
library.

The project is hosted on https://github.com/pierre-labastie/blocaled

Use this project issue tracker for reporting bugs.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/localed for the D-Bus
protocol description.

The configuration files holding the locale settings may be choosen at compile
time or through the /etc/localedrc file (TODO!). See the man page and the
configure --help output.

Note that blocaled expects any shell-syntax settings files that it
modifies to be in UTF-8 encoding, and to consist only of comments and simple
scalar assignments, i.e. something like

# a comment
foo="bar"
baz='Let'\''s go!'

If blocaled fails to parse a settings file, it will refuse to modify it.
