Blocaled provides a stand-alone implementation of the localed D-Bus service.

It is maintained by BLFS editor Pierre Labastie, for the specific needs of
the BLFS project, but may be used on any system implementing the libgio
library.

The project is hosted on https://github.com/lfs-book/blocaled

Use this project issue tracker for reporting bugs.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/localed for the D-Bus
protocol description.

The configuration files holding the locale settings may be chosen at compile
time or through the '$sysconfdir'/blocaled.conf file. See the man page and the
output of configure --help.

Note that blocaled expects any shell-syntax settings files that it
modifies to be in UTF-8 encoding, and to consist only of comments and simple
scalar assignments, i.e. something like

# a comment
foo="bar"
baz='Let'\''s go!'

If blocaled fails to parse a settings file, it will refuse to modify it.

For the X11 keyboard settings, the file is in Xorg.conf format. It must have
an "InputClass" Section, containing a "MatchIsKeyboard" line, to be
able to parse Options "XkbLayout", "XkbModel", "XkbVariant", "XkbOptions"
directives. Such a section may be added by the program if it
does not exist.
