openrc-settingsd provides an implementation of the the hostnamed, localed,
and timedated DBus services for OpenRC-based systems - in particular, for
typical installations of Gentoo Linux.

Bugs should be reported (for the moment) to gnome@gentoo.org

Hostnamed:

 See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/hostnamed for the DBus
 protocol description.

 The static hostname is stored in /etc/conf.d/hostname as
 hostname="foo"

 The pretty hostname and icon name are stored in /etc/machine-info as
 PRETTY_HOSTNAME="Foo !"
 ICON_NAME="computer-desktop"

Note that openrc-settingsd expects any shell-syntax settings files that it
modifies to be in UTF-8 encoding, and to consist only of comments and simple
scalar assignments, i.e. something like

# a comment
foo="bar"
baz='Let'\''s go!'

If openrc-settingsd fails to parse a settings file, it will refuse to modify
it.
