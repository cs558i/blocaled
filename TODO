Refactor on_handle_set_* callbacks (lots of code duplication currently).

Implement localed and timedated.

Do something about runtime dependency on systemd's org.freedesktop.hostname1.policy,
org.freedesktop.locale1.policy, and org.freedesktop.timedate1.policy files.

Decide how openrc-settingsd should be started (/etc/init.d? dbus activation?
might that conflict with systemd's services or files in some way?)

Make an ebuild, and add it to portage!
