Add nss-myhostname detection

Source /etc/rc.conf after /etc/conf.d/$service; do something intelligent
if the relevant variable is set in /etc/rc.conf (go to read-only mode?)

What happens if e.g. /etc/conf.d/hostname.{runlevel} files exist? Just
document that this case is not supported?

Write an init.d file to read RC_SYS so that we can piggyback on openrc's
built-in virtualization detection.

Implement localed and timedated.

Do something about runtime dependency on systemd's org.freedesktop.hostname1.policy,
org.freedesktop.locale1.policy, and org.freedesktop.timedate1.policy files.

Decide how openrc-settingsd should be started (/etc/init.d? dbus activation?
might that conflict with systemd's services or files in some way?)

Make an ebuild, and add it to portage!
